# blocking_estimation
Code for the paper "Analysis of Blocking in mmWave Cellular Systems: Estimation of Coverage Maps in Urban Scenarios"

## Project structure
* Main code contains the essential code to run the paper simulations
* Paper simulations contains code that can be added to the main code to obtain the plots from the paper

## Observations
To run the code probability_OK_cpp has to be compiled for your machine. This requires installing the boost libraries, and requires Matlab 2019 or later. Getting all the dependencies to work may be tricky. Good luck.
